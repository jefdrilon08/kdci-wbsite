                <p>kasagana-Ka is a developmental organization for the urban poor communities. It offers a holistic range of products and services to meet the needs and bring positive change to the lives of the urban poor and their communities. Along with credit for livelihood activities and micro entrepreneurship, Kasagana-Ka also provides our members with support in the field of housing, health, education and microinsurance. Every product is delivered with utmost dedication and respect in the capacity of the urban poor to realize their full potentials towards attainment of sufficiency and responsibility.  </p>
                <p>At the board, we recognize strong leadership as key to what Kasagana-Ka has accomplished in a decade on which we aspire for continuing growth and service. We take pride, for instance, that the board consists of both the nanays or the member representatives and professionals. We have two client - beneficiary representatives, Weni and Letty, who bring important perspectives of the urban poor community to relevant issues; the professionals bring their experience in business and technical know-how on the economy, and other relevant fields. This variety in backgrounds brings balance to policy-making for more grounded decision-making in the organization. </p>
                        <p align="justify">The management team, headed by Me-An show their commitment to the mission by professionally running the organization. Systems have been installed to ensure efficiency in service-delivery. Strategic partnerships have been forged to increase our effectiveness in providing a broader range of products and services for the urban poor. </p>
                        <p align="justify">Our committed staff, supported by the center leaders, demonstrate good management of their respective client centers through the smooth flow of transactions and good cooperation between staff and client - beneficiaries. For their commitment and hard work, Kasagana-Ka takes good care of the staff. We pay them well and we provide them appropriate training to build capacity and open up opportunities to grow in the organization. </p>
                        <p align="justify">Over the years, we exercised prudence with the resources entrusted to us. We focused our efforts at building institutional capacity and explored and piloted models and approaches to come up with a compelling mix of products and services tailor-fitted to the needs and aspirations of the urban poor. I am confident that all the work, sacrifices and creativity employed in the first decade of operations of Kasagana-Ka will do well to usher us to the next decade of greater service. There are many more urban poor communities beyond Metro Manila and we foresee a future that entails expansion of our services in other urban poor communities as well.</p>
