                <p>Kasagana-Ka Development Center, Inc. initiates its services with mothers who are either breadwinners or wish to enhance their contributions to their familys income. These mothers should have a desire to engage in a small business enterprise, and be of sound body, mind, and moral values. They are organized into a center of 14 to a maximum of 40 members, who have chosen each other from within the same urban poor locality. One of two required loan co-makers of a borrower-member has to come from among fellow members of a center; the other has to be a family member, either the spouse, an offspring of legal age, a parent, or a sibling.</p>
				<p>    Kasagana-Ka provides a centers first-time borrower with PHP3,000 5,000, depending on the results of a credit investigation and the agreement of the - co-makers. This amount may be increased by PHP3,000 - 5,000 every loan cycle. It may be doubled upon reaching PHP30,000 and may reach a maximum of PHP150,000. The initial loan, which is provided under K-Negosyo Window 1, may be provided to a center member who has yet to start contributing to the capital build up, that is, to the K-Impok (savings) fund. A member who wishes to obtain a loan of PHP30,000 or more, however, should already be in the 8th loan cycle (which is generally equivalent to two years of center membership) and needs to maintain a savings balance of at least 20 percent of the loan amount. This loan is processed under Window 2, which specifically assists client-beneficiaries who have demonstrated good performance in their microenterprises, are active in center activities, and wish to expand their businesses or engage in another enterprise that requires a bigger capital. Whether obtained through Window 1 or Window 2, a loan is charged an interest rate of 2.5 percent a month and is payable in 15 or 25 weeks. A processing fee (2-3 percent) as well as contribution to a loan redemption fund (0.375-0.75 percent) and to the microinsurance of Kasagana-Ka Mutual Benefit Association, Inc. is deducted from the loan amount. Collections are made a day before the weekly center meetings. The center meetings, thus, do not constitute as a loan repayment point but an opportunity to develop solidarity and discipline among the members. More important, the center and its regular meetings serve as a mechanism through which other products and services flow. The center meeting is attended by the Kasagana-Ka socioeconomic officer, who also serves as a loan officer. Kasagana-Ka ensures that a loan is released 3-5 days after the borrower has complied with all the requirements. During a center meeting a week after the release of the loan, the borrower undergoes a loan utilization check and status reporting. Receipts of goods and other items purchased in connection with the business for which a loan was obtained are presented. The socioeconomic officer also visits the business location. Except the co-makers, center members are not responsible for repaying the loan of a defaulting member. They get involved, however, in the " sit-down policy," during which members accompany their socioeconomic officer to the home of a member who failed to make a weekly contribution and stay until a payment is made.
